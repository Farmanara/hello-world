# hello-world
I'm getting familiar with GitHub
This is the sudden try for learning ( better say, getting familiar with) GitHub.
I have bachelor's in Electronics and work in IT field - networks- , I am interested in coding though I don't know much about it, I had some very basic experience in coding when I tried to code some microcontrollers during university and it has always been interesting for me eventhough they were very simple codes, like making LEDs blink :).
I'm really interested to learn coding and developing applications and making connection between the application and electronic hardwares, but I am really confused how and where to start,which path to choose and follow, I'm all on my own as I'm not a student anymore and there's no one to guide me, I know that selfstudy will need a lot of self motivation. I sometimes have it and most of the tiems I don't.
That's why this is a sudden try. I'm in the motivated period.
It's a shot in the dark, but I hope someone will see this here and consult me and clarify some path for me or I dunno whatever that takes away this confusion of being interested but not knowing what to do first as it's a very big world with huge amount of data and options.
